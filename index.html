	<h2>Why use Pico?</h2>
	<p>For a Webmaster or other content management professional, Pico's architecture makes it use very straightforward.</p>
	<h3>Templates in Twig</h3>
	<p><a href="https://twig.symfony.com" title="Twig Website">Twig</a> is a template engine for PHP.</p>
	<p>It allows the webmaster/developer to add placeholders for data in standard HTML files.</p>
	<p>By using Twig Pico, can adopt the look and feel of virtually any commercially available template.</p>
	<h3>Content in Markdown</h3>
	<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown" title="Markdown: Daring Fireball">Markdown</a> converts a simplified text format to standard HTML.</p>
	<p>Pico stores the website's content in (markdown) text files.</p>
	<p>The website' menu structure is (logically) based on the folder structure of these text files.</p>
	<h4>Pico gives direct access to data making editing, backup and transfer very easy and simple.</h4>
	<p>The routine work for a webmaster or other content manager is editing text and uploading files (mostly images).</p>
	<p>One might expect a layman to need the administrative backend of more common database-driven CMSs however ... even they (e.g. administrative assistants) may appreciate the straightfoward process of <b>simply typing their information into a text file and dropping an image into a folder</b> as the totality of updating the website.</p>
	<p>The text files an images can be reviewed, emailed and otherwise minipulated as normal.</p>
	<p><b>Moving the website</b> is simply copying the entire folder to a USB and uploading it somewhere else.</p>
	<h2>Other Features</h2>
	<p>Pico has a plugin architecture. Its functions can be extended with custom features.</p>
